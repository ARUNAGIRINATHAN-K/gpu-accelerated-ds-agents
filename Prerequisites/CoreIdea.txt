🚀 Core Idea:

You are building a Data Analyst Agent — an AI-powered assistant that can understand natural language queries about datasets, analyze the data automatically, and return insights in structured and visual formats.

🔹 What It Does:

Accepts datasets (CSV, Excel, etc.) from users

Interprets user queries in plain English (e.g., “What’s the average revenue by country?”)

Translates those queries into validated data operations using Pydantic-AI schemas

Executes analysis with Python (Pandas/Polars)

Presents results as tables, charts, or text summaries in an interactive interface (Streamlit or HTML/Bootstrap/JS frontend)

🔹 Why It’s Unique:

Schema-driven reasoning: Instead of letting the AI hallucinate, you constrain it with Pydantic models (ensures valid, structured outputs).

No coding required for the user: Non-technical people can explore datasets just by typing questions.

Interactive visualization: Automatically generates the best-suited charts and explanations for insights.

Scalable design: Can extend beyond descriptive analytics to forecasting, anomaly detection, or even predictive modeling.

🔹 Problem It Solves:

Many people have data but lack SQL/Python skills to analyze it.

Current dashboards require predefined charts and filters, not flexible natural language queries.

Your project makes data analysis conversational, intuitive, and dynamic.

🔹 One-Line Definition (for portfolio/LinkedIn):

“An AI-powered Data Analyst Agent that converts natural language queries into validated data insights and visualizations using Pydantic-AI.”
